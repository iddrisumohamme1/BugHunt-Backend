## Database Setup

BugHunt uses MongoDB Atlas as its database. Follow these steps to set up your database:

1. Go to the MongoDB Atlas website (https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
2. Create a new account or sign in to an existing one.
3. Create a new project named "BugHunt".
4. Set up a new cluster (choose the free tier for starting out).
5. Once your cluster is ready, click on "Connect".
6. Create a database user and whitelist your IP address when prompted.
7. Choose "Connect your application" and copy the provided connection string.
8. In your BugHunt project, locate the database configuration file (likely named something like `db.js` or `database.js`).
9. Replace the existing connection string with your new MongoDB Atlas connection string.
10. Make sure to replace `<password>` in the connection string with your actual database user password.

Your BugHunt application will now be configured to connect to your MongoDB Atlas database.
